# Gameplay
This game presents a fast-paced aquatic adventure! Twenty colorful fish, a mix of harmless yellow and dangerous red, dart around the screen. 
You control a blue player fish using the mouse, strategically maneuvering it to gobble up the yellow fish. Each tasty yellow morsel bumps your score up by a point, 
while accidentally chomping on a red one comes with a point deduction. The clock is ticking, with only 20 seconds to maximize your fishy feast. Once time runs out, 
the game displays your final score. Don't fret if you didn't break any records, just press F2 and dive back into the feeding frenzy!
